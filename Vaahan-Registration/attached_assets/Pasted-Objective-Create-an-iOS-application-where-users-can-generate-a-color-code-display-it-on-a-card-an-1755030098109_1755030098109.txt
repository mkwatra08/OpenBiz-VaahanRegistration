Objective: Create an iOS application where users can generate a color code, display it on a
card, and store it locally when offline. When the internet is available, sync the selected color with
Firebase.
Features and Requirements
1. Color Code generation Screen
Allow users to generate a random hex code and then display the corresponding color in
the card, users can generate multiple hex codes and all the cards should be displayed
on the screen.
2. Local Data Storage (Offline Handling)
Store the selected color codes along with the timestamp locally when offline for
simplicity.
● Persistent Color: Ensure the all selected color is displayed after the app is closed and
reopened.

indicator.
5. Error Handling
● Basic Error Handling: If syncing with Firebase fails due to network issues, retry syncing
once internet is restored.
